What is a "static" diagram, what is a "dynamic" diagram. 

Activity diagrams are what?

Are state machines static or dynamic?

a static diagram describing a system configuration that is only available in one "mode/state"
has a dynamic aspect, as it is not active over the complete runtime

reduce dynamics to simple "models", dynamics are difficult to handle and grasp for humans

dynamics can be very fast ==> impacts and consequences hard to tackle for humans, obersvation is
difficult
==> software is limited regarding "how fast" by the computing platform/resources ... "abtasttheorem",
some things might not be observed good enough

dynamics can be very slow ==> impacts and consequences hard to tackle for humans, obersvation is
difficult
==> e.g. very seldom you see a dynamic diagram showing the overall lifecycle (> 10 years) of a
technical product (or it is super general), partly ok, because "software does not age", but 
e.g. there must be a possibility foreseen to deactivate a certain functionality later (via update
or command)


the current "mode" can be seen as "context" for a static diagram
